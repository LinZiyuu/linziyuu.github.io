Hi! I am Ziyu Lin (林子瑜 in Chinese). I am currently a Research Associate at Nanyang Technological University. In Spring 2026, I will become a PhD Student in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at NTU, co-advised by [Prof. XiaoFeng Wang](https://wangxiaofeng7.github.io/) and [Prof. Wei Dong](https://ntu-dps.com/). My research focuses on 5G security and network protocol security. My research results have received acknowledgments from well-known CDN vendors such as Azure, Alibaba, Baidu, Cloudflare, Cachefly, Edgio, G-Core, Qiniu, and Tencent
