Hi! I am Ziyu Lin (林子瑜 in Chinese). I am a Research Assistant in the National University of Singapore. I work in the CISCO & NUS Lab and am advised by [Prof. Sikdar Biplab](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/biplab-sikdar/) and [Prof. Prosanta Gope](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cs/people/academic/prosanta-gope). My research focuses on 5G security and network protocol security. My research results have received acknowledgments from well-known CDN vendors such as Azure, Alibaba, Baidu, Cloudflare, G-core, Cachefly, Qiniu, and Upyun.
